# Implementing various data structure and algorithms using python

Data structures and algorithms are among the most fundamental concepts of Computer Science. Whether it’s real-world problems we’re trying to solve or the typical coding question asked in an interview, almost every problem requires us to demonstrate a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms for better optimized approach to the problem.

This repo aims to come up with a detailed code solution of the various data structures and algorithms that we’ll see in interviews and everyday work. With implementation details, through comments, and hands-on coding examples for the same.
